# Machine Learning Lab

This repository contains the machine learning lab files for various experiments covered in the course. Each lab covers a specific machine learning algorithm or technique, implemented using Python and various ML libraries.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Cost Function
- *Objective*: Implementation of the cost function for a simple linear regression model.
- *Description*: This lab introduces the concept of the cost function, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), and demonstrates how it is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.

### Lab 2: Linear Regression
- *Objective*: Implementation of linear regression from scratch.
- *Description*: This lab covers the fundamentals of linear regression, including hypothesis functions, gradient descent, and the computation of model parameters.

### Lab 3: Logistic Regression & Multiclass Logistic Regression
- *Objective*: Implement logistic regression for binary classification and extend it to multiclass classification using one-vs-all.
- *Description*: 
  - *Part 1*: Binary logistic regression implementation.
  - *Part 2*: Multiclass logistic regression using the one-vs-all approach for multiple classes.

### Lab 4: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- *Objective*: Implementation of SVM for both regression and classification tasks.
- *Description*: 
  - *Part 1*: Support Vector Regression (SVR) implementation.
  - *Part 2*: Support Vector Classification (SVC) implementation using a linear and non-linear kernel.

### Lab 5: Decision Tree
- *Objective*: Implementation of Decision Tree for classification tasks.
- *Description*: This lab demonstrates the usage of decision trees, including the creation of a model, tree pruning, and evaluation using different datasets.
